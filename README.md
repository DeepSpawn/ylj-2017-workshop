# Yow Lambda Jam 2017 - ReasonML Workshop

This workshop runs through two projects, koans and minesweeper. The first project is a koans folder with a number of TDD tasks to introduce the language elements and features. The second task is a step by step introduction to applying the language to building the game Minesweeper.

Each of these projects is self-documenting. You should start in the koans project, and follow the instructions there. Once that project is completed, or you feel comfortable going ahead, you should begin in the minesweeper project.

Please make sure you have cloned this repository and run all the installation instructions before coming to the workshop on the 9th.
